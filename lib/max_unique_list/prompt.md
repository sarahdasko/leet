# Alien Karaoke Playlist

A karaoke machine on an alien planet has a playlist of songs, each represented by an integer ID. The alien loves variety, so it wants to find the longest contiguous segment of songs where no ID repeats.

If two segments are tied in length, return the first one that appears.

## Input
A list of integers songs (length â‰¤ 1e5, IDs between 1 and 1e9).

## Output
The subarray (list of integers) that represents the longest segment with all unique songs.
